<h2>A special perspective: a contemporary novel?</h2>
      <p> 
Galbert's source is truly unique: because of the expensiveness of writing material (parchment) and high levels of illiteracy among the largest part of the medieval population, it is uncommon that there are written remains of how normal people lived through these kinds of political situations. And his text is so lively and vivid! It not only gives us information about the political situation, but also about a great many elements of everyday medieval life:

‘And when the betrayers had withdrawn into the temple the citizens did not pursue them further but turned back for the sake of plunder and loot, running here and there through the count’s house and the provost’s house and the brothers’ dormitory and cloister. (…) They snatched numerous bed coverings, tapestries, linens, goblets, caldrons, chains, iron bolts, restrains, fetters, bowstrings, shackles, manacles, the iron instruments used with all prisoners, and the iron doors of the count’s treasure, and the lead gutters that carried water from the roof, believing that they could steal without incurring any blame.’

As an historical source Galbert’s text is thus very rich and also very useful! All kinds of questions about medieval life can be answered. But the <em>Galbert-Goldmine</em> does have its dangers. The historian Jeff Rider has found that Galbert, while writing this thrilling source, has structured his text quite a bit. This puts the text somewhere between a literate text and an eye-witness account. Galbert could have changed elements to improve the flow of the text. A historian should always be on the lookout for such changes. But a reader, like you could be :), will probably just enjoy his text tremendously!
