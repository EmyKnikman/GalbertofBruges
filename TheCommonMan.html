<h2>A special perspective: a contemporary novel?</h2>
      <p> 
Because of the expensiveness of writing material (parchment) and high levels of illiteracy among the largest part of the medieval population, it is uncommon that there are written remains of how normal people like you and me lived through these kinds of political situations. During this situation however, a notary called Galbert, who lived in Bruges, where the count was murdered, and because of his profession was able to write, started making sense of the events around him by writing down what was happening.  His text not only gives us information about the political situation, but also about a great many elements of everyday medieval life.

‘March 18, Friday, the ladders were brought to the castle walls, and both sides attacked with arrows and stones.’

‘And when the betrayers had withdrawn into the temple the citizens did not pursue them further but turned back for the sake of plunder and loot, running here and there through the count’s house and the provost’s house and the brothers’ dormitory and cloister. (…) They snatched numerous bed coverings, tapestries, linens, goblets, caldrons, chains, iron bolts, restrains, fetters, bowstrings, shackles, manacles, the iron instruments used with all prisoners, and the iron doors of the count’s treasure, and the lead gutters that carried water from the roof, believing that they could steal without incurring any blame.’

The historian Jeff Rider has found out that Galbert, while writing this thrilling source, has structured his text quite a bit. This puts the text somewhere between a literate text and an eye-witness account. Do you think this text can still be used as a historical source? Is it important that the perspective of everyday people is present in historical research? Please let us know in the comment section!
