<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
Emy Knikman is in her second year of the MA <a href="https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/ancient-medieval-and-renaissance-studies">Medieval Historys</a> at Utrecht University. She began her academic career with a BA in Dutch Law and BA in Philosophy of Law (at Erasmus University in Rotterdam), in which she also studied the history of philosophy (and dedicated her BA thesis to the history of the counter-enlightenment). She then went on to finish a double MA in civil and procedural law (also at Erasmus University). For her civil law MA, she did her thesis on the history of law. This inspired her to change directions and dedicate her further research to the history of law. For her thesis she wishes to use her knowledge of contracts and apply this to the medieval context.
