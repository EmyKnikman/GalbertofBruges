<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
I am in my second year of the MA <a href="https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/ancient-medieval-and-renaissance-studies">Medieval History</a> at Utrecht University. I began my academic career with a BA in Dutch Law and BA in Philosophy of Law (at Erasmus University in Rotterdam), in which I also studied the history of philosophy (and dedicated my BA thesis for philosophy to the history of the counter-enlightenment). I then went on to finish a double MA in civil and procedural law (also at Erasmus University). For my civil law MA, I did my thesis on the history of law. This inspired me to change directions and dedicate my further research to the history of law. For my thesis I wish to use my knowledge of contracts and apply this to the medieval context.
